## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `Interface.ts`: Contains examples related to TypeScript interfaces.
- `Tuples.ts`: Contains examples related to TypeScript tuples.
- `Union.ts`: Contains examples related to TypeScript union types.
- `index.ts`: Entry point of the application.

# TypeScript Project

Welcome to my TypeScript project! This project serves as a playground for practicing TypeScript concepts and features.

## Overview

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing to the language. It provides enhanced tooling, better error checking, and improved code organization compared to plain JavaScript. TypeScript code is transpiled to JavaScript, making it compatible with all JavaScript environments.


## Development

Feel free to contribute to this project by adding more TypeScript examples or improving existing ones. Here's how you can contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-feature`.
3. Make your changes.
4. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add my feature"`.
5. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/my-feature`.
6. Submit a pull request.

## TypeScript Topics

### Interfaces
Interfaces in TypeScript allow you to define the structure of an object. They describe the properties and methods that an object should have. Interfaces promote code reusability and help in maintaining type safety.

### Classes
Classes in TypeScript allow you to create blueprint templates for objects. They encapsulate data for the object and define methods to operate on that data. Classes support inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, making them a powerful tool for object-oriented programming.

### Enums
Enums in TypeScript allow you to define a set of named constants. They provide a way to represent a group of related values as a single unit. Enums improve code readability and maintainability by giving meaningful names to numeric values.

### Generics
Generics in TypeScript allow you to create reusable components that work with a variety of data types. They enable you to write flexible and type-safe functions, classes, and interfaces. Generics are particularly useful when writing data structures and algorithms.

### Type Annotations
Type annotations in TypeScript allow you to specify the data type of variables, parameters, and return values. They provide compile-time checks for type correctness and help in detecting errors early in the development process. Type annotations enhance code readability and documentation.

### Union Types
Union types in TypeScript allow you to combine multiple types into a single type. They enable you to work with values that can be of different types at runtime. Union types provide flexibility and expressiveness in handling heterogeneous data.

### Tuples
Tuples in TypeScript allow you to represent an ordered collection of elements with fixed length and known data types. They provide a way to store and manipulate multiple values as a single entity. Tuples are useful for functions that return multiple values or for dealing with fixed-size arrays.

### Type Inference
Type inference in TypeScript allows the compiler to automatically deduce the data types of variables and expressions. It analyzes the context in which values are used and infers the most appropriate types. Type inference reduces the need for explicit type annotations and improves code conciseness.
